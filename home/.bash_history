jrnl: Setting up laptop, jailbreaking Ipod Touch, Dinner Party at Co-worker's house. Today I continued to set up the my laptop with Ubuntu. Finally installed a solarized theme and everything feels the way it did before. Now looking into backup solutions after the data I lost when ASUS reformatted my hard drive. Today I also jailbroke the Ipod Touch 2g that Damien let me borrow. It looks nice, but I have no idea what to do with it. There was also a dinner party at one of mom's friend's houses. We had pasta and watermelon salad. Mom let me drive home. Finished Chapter 6 of the Linux course and am getting ready for bed.

jrnl today: Bandit War Games, Kali Linux, Telnet, and Band. Today was Mr. Downey's first day back. We replaced a couple of teacher computers, and I spent lunch working through more of the bandit war games. Learned more about the "find" command and ssh. Damien explained to me what Telnet is, and I used it in one of the games. Downloaded the Kali ISO so we can test that out later this week. I also had an idea to create a website to add printers for the teachers. Damien likes it. Currently at band practice. This is the first practice as drum major. Currently doing nothing.

jrnl 13 august: More Work Orders and AOE. Today was a simple day at work, we did work orders and played Age of Empires. I worked on the printer website for Damien. I had to go through a flask tuorial again to learn how to use it. I need to practice. By the end of this year I want to be proficient in Java, Android, and Python. I think I can do it.
jrnl yesterday: Last Day of Internship. Today was the last day of internship, and it was filled with work. We had to move all the recycling back up to storage, but Downey treated us all out to lunch at Friday's. I'm gonna miss Francis, he was really funny and knew a lot, but this year is gonna be a good one.
